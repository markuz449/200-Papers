1. Because the class name doesn't match the filename the program won't compile.
Hi.java:1: error: class hi is public, should be declared in a file named hi.java
public class hi {
       ^
1 error

2. All what's changing is the output and that "hello" isn't capitalized.
hello, world!

3. A bunch of Syntax errors stop the program from running because now the print statement is expecting a variable called 'Hello' which doesn't exist and because the final quotation mark is there it doesn't get closed causing more errors.
Hi.java:3: error: ')' expected
System.out.println(Hello, world!");
                               ^
Hi.java:3: error: unclosed string literal
System.out.println(Hello, world!");
                                ^
Hi.java:3: error: ';' expected
System.out.println(Hello, world!");
                                   ^
Hi.java:5: error: reached end of file while parsing
}
 ^
4 errors

4. Removing the last quotation mark leaves the string open and causes a syntax error.
Hi.java:3: error: unclosed string literal
System.out.println("Hello, world!);
                   ^
Hi.java:3: error: ';' expected
System.out.println("Hello, world!);
                                   ^
Hi.java:5: error: reached end of file while parsing
}
 ^
3 errors

5. The program can't run because the main method is missing and java requires the main method to start it's programs.
Error: Main method not found in class Hi, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application

6. A sysntax error because java doesn't recognise printline, it should be println.
Hi.java:3: error: cannot find symbol
System.out.printline("Hello, world!");
          ^
  symbol:   method printline(String)
  location: variable out of type PrintStream
1 error

7. Removing the semicolon at the end causes a syntax error because java doesn't realise that the line of code has come to an end and to move on. 
Hi.java:3: error: cannot find symbol
System.out.printline("Hello, world!");
          ^
  symbol:   method printline(String)
  location: variable out of type PrintStream
1 error

8. With the last brace gone java doesn't regocnise the end of the class.
Hi.java:4: error: reached end of file while parsing
    }
     ^
1 error
